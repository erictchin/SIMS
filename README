The Server or KDC
=================

There is a similar README with more information in the ./server/ directory.

To compile the server, first `cd` into ./server and run 
  * "make build" or
  * "javac -cp ../libs/json-simple-1.1.1.jar:../libs/commons-io.jar: \
      ../libs/commons-codec.jar:../encrypt/ ./Server.java"

To run the server, `cd` into ./server and run 
  * "make server" or 
  * "java -cp ../libs/json-simple-1.1.1.jar:../libs/commons-io.jar: \
      ../libs/commons-codec.jar:../encrypt/: Server <port>"

  Note: "make server" will default to use port 9008.  This can be changed but must be 
  kept consistent between the server and the client.

  Note: to distribute the server alone, the three directories ./server/, ./encrypt, 
  and ./libs are required.



The Client
==========

There is a similar README in the ./client/ directory.

To compile the client, first `cd` into ./client and run 
  * "make build" or
  * "javac -cp ../libs/json-simple-1.1.1.jar:../libs/commons-io.jar: \
       ../libs/commons-codec.jar:../encrypt/ ./Client.java"

To run the client, `cd` into ./client and run 
  * "make client" or 
  * "java -cp ../libs/json-simple-1.1.1.jar:../libs/commons-io.jar: \
       ../libs/commons-codec.jar:../encrypt/: Client <server ip> <port>"

  Note: "make client" will default to use server ip `localhost` and port `9008`.  
  This is arbitrary and can be changed but must be kept consistent between the server 
  and the client.

  Note: to distribute the client alone, the three directories ./client/, ./encrypt, 
  and ./libs are required.



Dependencies
============

Developed and tested using Java version "1.6.0_27" and the OpenJDK Runtime 
Environment as currently installed in the CCIS Linux environment.

This program requires "json-simple" (http://code.google.com/p/json-simple/),
an open source Java library for JSON to encode and decode JSON text.

This program requires "commons-io" and "commons-codec", two libraries from
Apache's suite of Java libraries called Commons.  They are respectively
used for file/network input/output and encoding.



Implementation
==============

Please view the ./docs/ directory, and particularly ./docs/sims-design-document.pdf
for more information on this implementation of a Secure Instant Messaging
System
