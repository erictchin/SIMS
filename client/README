Secure Instant Messaging System (Client)
========================================

To compile the client, run
  * `make build` or
  * `javac -cp ../libs/json-simple-1.1.1.jar:../libs/commons-io.jar: \
      ../libs/commons-codec.jar:../encrypt/ ./Client.java`

To run the client, run
  * `make client` or
  * `java -cp ../libs/json-simple-1.1.1.jar:../libs/commons-io.jar: \

  on the functionality provided to the user.
